{{ site.tagline }}

{% include toc-flammarion.md %}

## First Subtitle

Place the introducing line of text ie.) the 'tagline' here ...

## Import Code

#### The Code: SVG In Markup

```liquid
{% raw %}
![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-725-x-725.svg){:height="500px" width="500px"}
{% endraw %}
```

Here, we are using an original `( .xcf )` file that has been exported from **GIMP** as a `( .psd )` of dimensions 725px x 725px x 96dpi and then imported via **Adobe Illustrator**, or **AI**.

Once inside **AI**, the `( .psd )` file is then "save as" an `( .svg )`.

Out comes an `( .svg )` file of dimensions 543.75px x 543.75px.

Now, an **SVG** file is both expandable and responsive.

To render a smaller version of the `( .svg )`, simply append an appropriate height and width, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{:height="120px" width="120px"}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Live Image: SVG In Markup

The following **Live** rendition of the **MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge** `( .svg )` image file is set to the dimensions of 500.00px x 500.00px.

![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-725-x-725.svg){:height="500px" width="500px"}

## Last Subtitle
