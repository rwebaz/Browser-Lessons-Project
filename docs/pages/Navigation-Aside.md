# Navigation Aside

Lessons written in (.html) are selectable when rendering options for the end-user to click.

{% include toc-flammarion.md %}

## Line Item Class Divider

The *Line Item Class Divider* functions as a visual stop between groups of five (5) lessons within each Topic at the Navigation aside of the main Concept Library, as follows:

```html
{% raw %}
<li class="divider"></li>
<li>Option 1</li>
<li>Option 2</li>
<li>Option 3</li>
<li>Option 4</li>
<li>Option 5</li>
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. The two service files that are also written in (.html) are partitioned at the bottom of the stack of options right above the partition for the link back to the (.html) written Home Page of the main Concept Library.
